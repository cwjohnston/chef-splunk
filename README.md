Description
===========

This cookbook automates retrieval, installation and configuration of a packaged version of Splunk from splunk.com. 

Requirements
============
As of this writing (version 0.1) Debian and Ubuntu are the only supported distributions. Patches to are welcome!

Recipes
=======

default.rb
----------

The default recipe retrieves a packaged version of the splunk data indexing, montioring, reporting and analysis software from splunk.com. The version of the package retrieved is constructed from the value set in `node[:splunk][:version]` and the machine architecture stored in `node[:kernel]
[:machine]`. The splunk service is configured to start at boot time with a default configuration.

Documentation for splunk is available at [splunk.com](http://www.splunk.com/base/Documentation/latest/Admin/)


apache_proxy.rb
---------------

When using the free Splunk license, authentication is not supported. This recipe implements a simple apache2 vhost on port 80 to proxy requests to your Splunk instance with basic HTTP authentication.

Attributes
==========
`splunk[:root]` - Sets the root directory of the splunk installation; splunk documentation refers to this as `$SPLUNK_HOME`. Defaults to /opt/splunk. Changing this value is not a good idea when installing from packages but it might actually be used by future installation methods.

`splunk[:version]` - Sets the version number of the desired splunk package to download and install in the format "N.N.N-NNNN". Defaults to latest as of cookbook release.

`splunk[:proxy_user]` - Sets the username for basic HTTP authentication when using `splunk::apache_proxy`. Default is 'admin' matching the default splunk username.

`splunk[:proxy_pass]` - Sets the hashed password for basic HTTP authentication when using `splunk::apache_proxy`. Default is hashed value for 'changeme' matching the default splunk password.

`splunk[:admin_password]` - Sets the default admin password. The default value is Splunk's default `changeme`.

Future Plans
============
* Consider using tarball install to simplify support for all distributions.
* Add support for configuring some general splunk parameters via attributes (e.g., web-port, splunkd-port, servername, datastore-dir, minfreemb).
* Add support for configuring logins via a data bag.
* Determine some method for automatically configuring splunk to use the built-in free license (splunk 4.2 and greater no longer respects the `$SPLUNK_HOME/etc/splunk.license` file).
* Add SSL support to `splunk::apache_proxy`.
* Consider refactoring `splunk::apache_proxy` to support other httpds (i.e. nginx).
* Add recipes for non-indexer configurations (e.g., distributed search head, forwarder, heavy forwarder, light forwarder).
